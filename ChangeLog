Revision history for Sub::Quote

  - fixed defer_info and undefer_sub from returning data for a deferred sub
    after it expires, even if the ref address matches
  - fixed defer_info not returning info for undeferred unnamed subs after the
    deferred sub expires
  - include options in defer_info return data
  - exclude internals from defer_info return data
  - document defer_info function

    failures.
  - added file and line options to quote_sub to allow specifying apparent
    source location.

    Sub::Quote::quote_sub.
